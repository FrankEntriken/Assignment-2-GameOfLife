# Assignment 2: Game of Life

This program runs a simulation called the Game of Life. The instructions for this game can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

This simulation includes the Class Game of Life, along with two variations that change how the program calculates
the neighbors of a cell. One is the Doughnut, which calculates neighbors as if the board was wrapped around horizontally
and vertically to resemble a doughnut shape. The other is Mirror, which makes the boundaries of the array act as if
they were mirrors, reflecting the positions of the established cells that border the edge of the board.

Sources are cited inline with where they were used.
